Hello, *coder*!

This site is more like an experiment playground.
Create a page, write whatever you want and then put up a PR.
There is no limit to how many pages you put up.
Just don't delete pages of other people.
You could also experiment with different frameworks like React or Vue.
To contribute, make a fork of this repo, update/create/re-create/improve the site, put up a Pull Request.

I wish that you have a good time here
And as always,
Happy Coding!
